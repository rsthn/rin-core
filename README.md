# Rin Front-End Library

This library provides functionality to build custom components and provides several pre-made components to build web application fast.



<br/>

## Installation

You can use npm to install the library, or download the standalone `rin-front.js` file from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file, in the latter case an object named 'Rin' or 'rin' will be available in the global scope.

```sh
npm i @rsthn/rin-front
```

> **NOTE:** When using the browser version `rin-front.js` the Rin library will be available as well because it is a dependency of this library.
