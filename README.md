# Rin Front-End Library

This library provides functionality to build custom elements, support connecting directly to [Wind](https://github.com/rsthn/rose-core/blob/master/Wind.md)-compliant web services and several pre-made elements to develop web applications fast.

## Installation

You can use npm to install the library, or download the standalone `rin-front.js` file from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file, in the latter case an object named `rfront` will be available in the global scope.

<small>**NOTE:** When using the web distribution, all definitions exported by [Rin](https://github.com/rsthn/rin/) will be available as exports from the `rfront` object.</small>

```sh
npm i @rsthn/rin-front
```


## Documentation

Visit our [docs](./docs) folder to view documentation of the exported classes and elements.
